 * !!! INDICATIVE STARTING PRICES — CONFIRM WITH JOHN BEFORE THIS PAGE GOES LIVE !!!
 * Grounded in published 2026 Melbourne guides: full residential demolition runs
 * roughly $15,000–$45,000 (about $40–$105/m²), with a small, clear, asbestos-free
 * block at the bottom of the range and a standard weatherboard around $12k–$18k.
 * The figures below sit at that honest floor. The deck warns a "from" number that
 * is too low just produces angry quote calls and burns the fixed-price promise
 * the whole brand rests on — so swap these for a figure Demo Bros would genuinely
 * honour on a small, clean, easy-access job the moment John confirms it.
 *
 * `from` (the H1 / meta / final-CTA anchor) is the SMALL-home figure.

/**
 * The most-read section for a knock-down-rebuild homeowner, because their builder
 * has already asked them for a date.
 *
 * !!! CONFIRM WITH JOHN: the durations below are indicative Melbourne figures
 * (published guides say 3–8 weeks first inspection to cleared site, most of it
 * approvals), not Demo Bros' measured averages. Steps 2, 3 and 4 are the ones to
 * check. They also appear in the FAQ answer on timing — change both together.
 *
 * All five steps carry a photo. `image` stays optional in the shape the page
 * reads, so a step can lose its photo without breaking the layout — it renders
 * as text on its own.
 *
 * `short` is the phone line and `detail` the desktop one. They are different
 * sentences on purpose: the compact phone card gives the copy about half a card's
 * width beside the thumbnail, where a three-line paragraph turns a clean row into
 * a block of text. `short` says the same thing in one line and carries the
 * duration with it, since the phone card has no room for the duration chip.
 *
 * Steps 01 and 02 are generated stand-ins shot to match the real library (same
 * overcast Melbourne light, same hi-vis, same suburban brick veneer): a quote on
 * a clipboard in front of the house, and the meters being checked against the
 * permit form. Swap both for real job photos when there are any — nothing in the
 * Demo Bros libraries covered either moment. Steps 03, 04 and 05 are real.

export const faqs = [

    q: "How much does it cost to demolish a house in Melbourne?",
    a: `Ours start at ${FROM_PRICE} for a small home on a clear block with no asbestos. Across Melbourne, full residential demolition generally runs between about $18,000 and $45,000 depending on size, asbestos, access and what else is on the block. What matters more than the headline number is what's inside it — ours includes the permit, all four disconnections, asbestos, the slab and a levelled block. Check the other quotes for the same list.`,
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the whole thing take?",
    a: "The demolition itself is usually under a week for a standard single-storey home. The approvals are the long part — permits and disconnections typically run 4–6 weeks, and we start them the day you accept. Most knock-downs run three to eight weeks end to end. You get the dates with the quote so you can give your builder a straight answer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle the demolition permit?",
    a: "Yes. The demolition permit and the council asset protection permit are both coordinated by us and included. You don't lodge anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about disconnecting power, gas and water?",
    a: "All four — power, gas, water and telecommunications — are arranged and confirmed before we start. Telecommunications is the one most quotes forget, and an un-disconnected service will stop a demolition on the morning.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you remove asbestos?",
    a: "Yes, and it's assessed before your quote is finalised rather than discovered on the day. It's removed and disposed of under licence with the documentation to prove it, and it sits inside the fixed price.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the concrete slab come out too?",
    a: "Yes, where it's required — slab and footings out of the ground, not left for your builder to deal with. Worth checking on your other quotes, because “demolition” doesn't always include it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about the pool, the trees and the driveway?",
    a: "All of it can go. Anything outside the house itself gets priced as its own line so you can see exactly what it costs and decide. Big trees sometimes need council approval or an arborist, and we'll tell you if yours is one of them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to tell my neighbours?",
    a: "No, we handle the notifications in writing. We also fence the site and keep dust under control, because you still have to live next door to these people after the build.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the block look like when you're finished?",
    a: "Empty, level and swept, with the waste gone and the ground ready for your builder to set out on. We photograph it at handover.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my builder start straight after?",
    a: "That's the point. Tell us the date they want it and we work back from that, or tell you early if it can't be met. The handover photos go to you and your builder the same day.",
