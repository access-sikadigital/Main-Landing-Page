/**
 * Full-width quote button pinned to the bottom of the screen on phones, per deck
 * build note 8.
 *
 * It slides up once the hero has scrolled fully out of view. Over the hero it
 * covered the bottom of the fold — the last hero bullet, the trust strip — while
 * the hero's own CTA was still on screen doing the same job. Past that point the
 * page is proof and detail, the original call to action is gone, and there is
 * nothing left competing with it.
 *
 * No panel behind it and no radius: the button IS the bar, edge to edge. The
 * white strip it used to sit on was a second surface announcing itself over the
 * page, and it cost the button width on exactly the screens with least of it.
 *
 * `usePastHero` is shared with the floating call button so the two arrive
 * together — see the hook for why it observes the hero rather than a scroll
 * offset.
