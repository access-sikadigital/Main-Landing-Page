 * One floating button: tap it and the phone dials.
 *
 * Hidden until the hero has scrolled past, on the same signal as the sticky
 * quote bar. Over the hero it sat on top of the fold while the hero's own "Call
 * 1800 960 625" button was still on screen — a second copy of the same action,
 * obscuring the page underneath it.
 *
 * It is an <a href="tel:"> rather than a button with a handler, so it behaves
 * like a phone number should: long-press to copy, right-click to save, and it
 * works with JavaScript off.
